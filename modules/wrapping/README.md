# Wrapping
This repository wraps Galasa dependencies that are not in an OSGI bundle into OSGI bundles which can be run in Galasa.

## Building locally
To build locally, you will need to generate a GPG key to sign the articacts with, so that you can prove 
the source of the artifacts are from you. The Private part of the GPG public-private keypair is used to 
do the signing. The GPG key is typically installed into your keyring/certificate store, and a passphrase/alias is 
used to address the private key. 
When we build artifacts, we sign them prior to deploying them to any external repository, so others can 
tell that the artifacts haven't been tampered-with, and that the source of the artifacts is genuine.
This is known as non-repudiation.

To build locally, use the `./build-locally.sh --help` command to see what other parameters are needed.

See the [documentation for the maven gpg plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-gpg-plugin/usage.html)
for information on other ways of specifying the GPG key to the build process.
